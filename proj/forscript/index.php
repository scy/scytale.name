<p>
<em>forscript</em> is an improved version of the standard Unix utility <em>script</em>.
Designing, programming and documenting it has been my bachelor thesis:
<a href='/doc/thesis/forscript.pdf'>Design and Implementation of a Forensic Documentation Tool for Interactive Command-line Sessions</a>.
As the title and the softwareâ€™s name suggest, its features are designed for usage by a forensic investigator.
</p><p>
It has been written following the paradigm of <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming'>literate programming</a>; the PDF contains both the source code and the documentation.
<em>forscript</em> is available as free software, find its <a href='http://github.com/scy/forscript'>source code on GitHub</a>.
If you are able to understand German, you may also want to read the <a href='/files/2010/03/forscript-abschlussvortrag.pdf'>slides of my final presentation</a>.
</p><p>
I will continue to maintain <em>forscript</em> in the future, patches and suggestions are encouraged, <a href='/contact/'>contact me<a>.
