Hi. I've removed <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/USER/NUMBER/">this photo</a> from the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/n-oe/">Night Over-Exposure</a> photo pool. This is not meant to be an offense, but rather an effort to keep the group limited to a specific kind of photos. In particular, I think your photo doesn't comply with #REPLACEME of the group's rules (read them at <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/n-oe/">the group page</a>).

Please note that this does not mean that your photo is ugly or not well done, I'm just saying that it doesn't fit into this specific group. Have a look at the other photos at <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/n-oe/pool/">the group pool</a> or <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/n-oe-bestof/">the best of</a> to see what Night Over-Exposure is all about. If you have any questions about this removal or think I'm wrong, please contact me or <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups_members.gne?id=35432914@N00">any other administrator</a>.
