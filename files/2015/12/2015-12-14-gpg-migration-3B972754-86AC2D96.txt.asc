I am transitioning from an old OpenPGP/GnuPG key to a new one.

The old key is this:
pub   4096R/3B972754 2015-04-12 [expires: 2016-04-11]
      Key fingerprint = 2970 DF22 3556 3364 7EC6  4E59 6E20 DFF0 3B97 2754

The new key is this:
pub   4096R/86AC2D96 2015-12-13 [expires: 2016-12-12]
      Key fingerprint = C5FF C707 2E7E 54E3 52A0  28E5 2721 FAA2 86AC 2D96

I am planning to keep that new key for a long time and extend its validity
yearly about three months before the expiration date.

The main reason behind this transition is the YubiKey NEO OpenPGP security
vulnerability published 2015-04-14 (CVE-2015-3298). I am replacing my old
YubiKey with a new one. While I'm at it, I'm setting up my key management
completely from scratch in a more stable and less hackish way.

The old key has not been used extensively, and even though there are no
indications that it has been compromised, I will replace it with the new one in
order to have a fresh start. The old key will be revoked in 2016 (or expire on
its own), but I prefer all correspondence to be encrypted with the new one. I
will not be signing anything with the old key anymore.

I was planning to sign this transition document with both keys to validate the
transition. However, it proves rather difficult to use two YubiKeys to create a
combined signature in a single GnuPG call. Therefore, the document is only
signed with the old key. I've also used the old key to sign the new key. I will
not sign the old key with the new one, since I want people to _stop_ using it
instead of giving it more credibility.

Please contact me if you have any questions.
