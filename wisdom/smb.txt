Accessing the C$ share on Windows XP hosts
==========================================

Even when connecting with an Administrator account and password, the C$ share 
(and other administrative shares) would return NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED. I ran 
the “set up a home network” assistant without success. Then I found a PDF[1] 
on the web which told me where the problem was: You need to disable the 
“simple file sharing” feature in the folder view(!) options.
