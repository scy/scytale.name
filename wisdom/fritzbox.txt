VoIP phone connected to Fritz!Box via intermediate router can’t send
====================================================================

Situation:

 VoIP phone --> router --> Fritz!Box

The phone is in another subnet. In my case, the router is protecting a trusted 
"core LAN" from other clients connected to the Fritz!Box, for example a 
Nintendo Wii.

The router allows RTP traffic to the phone and does not restrict the phone’s 
outgoing connections in any way. Still, when I called somebody, I could hear 
them quite fine, but they couldn’t hear me. SIP traffic (signalling) worked 
like a charm in both directions.

The problem turned out to be that the phone sent its outgoing RTP data not to 
the Fritz!Box IP, but to 169.254.1.1, apparently because the box instructs it 
to. However, the box itself sends its data to the phone from its defined LAN 
IP address, but is available under the 169 address as well. According to the 
manual, the box claims this IP always.

There are two possible solutions. First, you could do something like

   route add 169.254.1.1 interface_to_fritzbox

on the router. It will then forward those strange destination address packages 
from the phone to the correct interface.

But since that address should actually be link-local, something like

   iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i protected_lan -p udp -d 169.254.1.1 \
      -j DNAT --to-destination your.fritzbox.ip

is more consistent and more beautiful.
