h2. SSH cannot use mode 0640 private keys, how can I use a “group key”?

So you’ve created an SSH key as root, chowned it to some group that should 
have access, chmodded it to 0640 and tried using it, but then SSH complained 
about “permissions too open”? Well, fear not.

This warning exists to keep people from doing stupid things with their keys. 
But if you know what you are doing, here’s the hint that will allow you to use 
group- or world-readable (heck, even -writable) keys: The permissions check is 
not made when you are not the owner of the key.

In other words: Set the owner to someone else (root, or someone who’s member 
of the target group but doesn’t need to use the key) and the group to the 
group you want. And then try it as a not-the-owner user. It works.

The check is in authfile.c, function key_perm_ok().
