I’m using a HTC Touch Pro and O2 Germany for mobile internet access. Since I 
have an unlimited data plan and my broadband DSL ISP “Alice” recently started 
having multi-hour downtimes, I decided to hook up my mobile phone to my router 
to provide uplink for my LAN.

This is a Windows Mobile 6.1 device with a feature called “internet connection 
sharing”. You hook it up via USB and the phone provides DHCP, DNS and does 
masquerading for the connected host. The Linux “rndis_host” module is required 
for this to work.


MTU problems with RNDIS devices
===============================

The network device that appears (it will be called “cell” from now on) starts 
with an MTU of 1492. However, this seems to be too large, and auto discovery 
does not work apparently. Therefore I set the MTU down manually:

  # ifconfig cell mtu 1380

I don’t know whether it’s the device’s or O2’s fault that I have to do that 
manually, all I know is that the device works flawlessly under Windows XP.

Gentoo users can configure the MTU value in /etc/conf.d/net:

  config_cell=dhcp
  mtu_cell=1380

However, after setting this MTU on the “cell” interface, I noticed that while 
now my router can access the net quite fine, LAN clients still had issues. 
They use the Ethernet MTU of 1500 and fail to get the correct path MTU, 
apparently because they never see the “fragmentation required” ICMP message.

Some googling led me to the TCPMSS iptables target, and its man page paragraph 
sounded exactly like the problems I experienced. So I added the following line 
to my iptables script:

  iptables -t mangle -A FORWARD -o cell -p tcp --tcp-flags SYN,RST SYN -j \
   TCPMSS --clamp-mss-to-pmtu

And now it works.
