	No idea whether that belongs to "Site Updates" or "community mailings", the two announcement lists on <<http://sourceforge.net/ SourceForge>> I'm subscribed to, as it's not mentioned in the mail.
	But there's got to be something seriously wrong when you're the largest web site for open source collaboration and think that you can send HTML-only mails to all the hardcore nerds you call your users.

	But this mail finally gave me a reason to terminate my account, which I hadn't been using for years anyway.
