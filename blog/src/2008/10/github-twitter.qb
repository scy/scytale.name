	Whoops.
</p>
<p>
	Turns out that <<http://github.com/ GitHub>> already has Twitter integration, they just hid it pretty well (under <em>Services</em> in the <em>Admin</em> tab).
	In that case there might actually be less people interested in <<https://scytale.name/proj/tweethub/ TweetHub>>, although it still has some advantages:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>You don't need to give GitHub your Twitter password. (Actually, that's Twitter's fault, their API doesn't allow for anything else.)</li>
	<li>You can change the information displayed in the tweets.</li>
	<li>You have <<http://is.gd/ is.gd>> URL shortening instead of <<http://tinyurl.com/ TinyURL>>.</li>
</ul>
