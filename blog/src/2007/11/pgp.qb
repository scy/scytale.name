<:New PGP keys><tags:English PGP GPG keys encryption signature>
<p>
	My PGP has been created over three years ago, with unlimited validity and 1024&nbsp;bit.
	I've decided to create a new one with four times as many bits and an expiration date, as well as updated user IDs.
	The new one is signed by the old one, which has been revoked afterwards.
	Time to start collecting new signatures.
	You can download it from your favorite keyserver or <</files/scytale.asc get my PGP key directly from here>>.
