<:Gentoo's sys-libs/glibc throws &quot;you need a kernel of at least version 2.6.9&quot; even before compiling><tags:Gentoo Computer>
<p><em>(Der Rest des Eintrags ist in Englisch, um m√∂glichst viele Leser zu erreichen.)</em></p>
<p>Don't even think about checking what kernel or linux-headers you've got installed. Most likely you're trying to install a new Gentoo system, but have not booted from a recent Gentoo LiveCD, but rather some other LiveCD or chroot'ed into your installation. A quick <samp>uname -a</samp> will reveal that you're indeed not using a kernel &gt;=2.6.9, because the LiveCD (or host system) you're using for your installation uses an older one. It's the <em>running</em> kernel that matters, not the one you've installed in your new Gentoo system.</p>
<p>Workaround: Use a newer LiveCD. If that's not possible, add "-nptl" to your USE-Flags, compile glibc, finish the installation, reboot into your new Gentoo system, remove "-nptl" again, recompile the glibc.</p>
